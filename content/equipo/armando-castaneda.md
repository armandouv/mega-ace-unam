I received a degree in Computer Engineering from the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN) of Mexico in 2002 and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from UNAM in 2007 and 2010.  Sergio Rajsbaum was my Ph.D. advisor. 
Before joining UNAM, I was post-doctoral associate at the Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique (INRIA), Rennes, and at the Department of  Computer Science of the Technion, hosted by Michel Raynal and Hagit Attiya, respectively.
